前两个课件放到WK10复习里边了

# IP address

32-bit identifier associated with each interface

# subnets

device interfaces can communicate with each other without passing through intervening router

high-bits: subnet bits

lower-bits: host part

# CIDR: Classless InterDomain Routing

a.b.c.d/x 32-x bits form the host identifier

12.4.0.0/15=12.4/15=12.4.0.0/255.254.0.0

ABC三类子网掩码类型,

A类是前8 bits 作为网络ID部分

B类是前16bits

C类是前24bits作为网络ID部分

# IPV6

128位

network operate with mixed IPV4 and IPV6?

IPV6 datagram carried as payload in IPV4 datagram among IPV4 routers.(packet within a packet)
