Network-layer functions

forwarding-data and routing-control

2 approaches to structuring network control plane.

1. per-router
2. logically centralized control

SDN: Software-Defined Network

NAT: network address translation

Intra-AS routing

RIP Routing Information Protocol-DV

EIGRP Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol-DV

OSPF link-state

OSPF

routers flood link-state advertisements(over IP) to all routers 

each router has full topology, DIjkstra algorithm to compute forwarding table

分层, hierachical OSPF

2-level hierachy, local area, backbone
