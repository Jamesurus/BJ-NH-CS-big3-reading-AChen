# 软件设计的要求-6个,objectives

correctness, robustness, flexibility, reusability, efficiency,reliability

# The process of software architecture

1. identify the key ==sub-systems and configuration== according to the requirements.
2. identify the ==relationships== among sub-systems.
2. identify the ==control model==.
2. ==decompose== the sub-systems into components then ==modules==.

# Architectural styles

1. client-server

2. repository

3. layered 

4. pipe and filter

5. service-oriented
6. model view controller

# Basic software design patterns

observer

singleton-单例模式
