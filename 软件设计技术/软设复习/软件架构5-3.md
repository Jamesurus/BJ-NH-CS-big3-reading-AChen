# how to architecture a software?

1. identify sub-systems and configuration according requirements
2. identify control model
3. decompose sub-systems into modules

# General application architecture

## improve system's performance:

localize critical operations, decrease communications

## security

layered architecture with critical assets in the inner layers.

## availability

For fault tolerance, including secondary components and mechanisms.

## maintainability

use fine-grain, which means layer

# 6 objectives of software architecture:

robustness

flexibility

reliability

correctness

re-usability

## efficiency

# some conflicts in software architecture:

performance - maintainability

fine-grain, maintainability

large-grain, performance

# What is architecture styles?

1. template/mechanism for structuring system architectures

2. stylized description of good design practice

3. include fit situations

4. may be represented using tabular and graphical descriptions

# Repository style

shared data is held in a repository and can be accessed by all sub-systems.

Floor sweepers use repository style.

# Layered architecture style

model the interfaces of sub-systems.

each layer provide service for the above layer

# client-server architecture style

servers provide services, clients call services, network allow clients to access servers.

For CS style, if 2 layers, thin and fat client, depending on application database management;s side, 

If you structure 3 layers, that's OK

# pipe and filter architecture style

Functional transformation from input to output.

Not suitable for the interactive systems.

When transformation is sequential, it's a batch sequential model, extensively used in data processing systems.

Each processing component(filter) is discrete and carries one data transformation type.

Example: process the invoice

The data transformation limits the certain input and output data structures, which means other types cannot be processed.

# Service-oriented architecture style

compose existing services to compose software systems.

client generate software from many providers.

Composing SO applications at runtime is called "orchestration"

## Example

if you need to do construction, just rent an Excavators, no need to buy one.

# Model-Viewer-Controller architectural style

provide multiple presentations for an object and separate interactions with these presentations.

# Examples for software architecture:

ticket-buying/ on line conference  system: client-server

floor cleaner robot: repository style
