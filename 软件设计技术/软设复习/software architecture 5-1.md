# What is Architecture Design?

design process-sub-systems framework including control and communication

# Software system development.

1. Define requirements
2. structuring the architectures
3. implementing

Software design is the process that transform requirements into a set of data structures or algorithms.

# 6 Software Design objectives:

1. correctness
2. robustness
3. flexibility
4. reusability
5. efficiency
6. reliability

# Design Process-6

1. architecture design
2. abstract specification
3. interface design
4. component design
5. data structure design
6. algorithm design

# Advantages of explicit architecture

1. stakeholder communication
2. system analysis
3. large-scale reuse

# Architectural representation
