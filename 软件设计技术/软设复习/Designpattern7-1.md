# what are the design patterns?

1. observer
2. singleton
3. adapter

Mainly for the reusability, 

when encountering ==similar problems, solutions to these problems are also similar==, reuse of these solutions.

# Structure of design patterns

1. name
2. description of problem
3. description of the solution
4. example of use
5. discussion of advantages/ disadvantages

# The observer pattern-behavioral

subject is independent from the observers, observers are dynamically assigned to the subject. subject informs observers about state changes.

# Singleton pattern-creational

singleton pattern, only one object is created, such as some global object is needed.

# Adapter pattern
